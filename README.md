## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.7 or above  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib
- seaborn

You can install required packages using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

```
### Dataset

Due to file size limitations, the dataset files are not included in this repository.

You can download similar datasets from public sources such as:

- Stack Overflow Developer Survey Data

- Kaggle - Programming Language Popularity Datasets

- Other publicly available programming trends datasets

After downloading, place the dataset CSV files into the /data folder of this project.

## Usage

### Run the main analysis script:

```bash
python analyze_trends.py
```
  #### Make sure your dataset files are correctly referenced in the script or config.
